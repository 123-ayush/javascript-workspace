//-------------------------------------DOM Events-----------------------------------------------------------------

// Dom Events -> Events are signals that something has occured.

// Examples of events:

// A user clicks a button

// A user types in an input box

// A webpage has loaded

// The mouse moves

// The user scrolls

// An element changes

// Whenever these actions happen, the browser fires an event, and you can write JavaScript that listens and responds to it.
